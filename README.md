# The Pool

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.7.

## Purpose

This custom table management system is to be used in adjacency with our CVCF Custom Registration Form here: 
https://github.com/JohnLHa/registration

The idea behind this project is to display and update the data of Attendees that have registered to this camp.
Functionality includes the ability to create/update/delete Attendee information, manage Attendee information within
a variety of tables, and allow Attendees to check-in on the camp weekend.

## Setup

Simply run `ng serve` for a dev server. Nagivate to `http://localhost:4200/` to interact with the current application.

## Firebase Firestore

We use Firebase's Firestore realtime database to manage our data. We chose this technology due to it's automatic scaling (Though we currently don't need it...potentially in the future we will). We also chose this technology due to it's affordability for small scale applications like this one.

## Future Plans

The future is here! We're currently working on getting this application up and running for this year's season of camps.
